    "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.\n",

    "For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n",

    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this question we can define a dictionary to store values of each roman character and then add the values using mapping from the dictionary. But this approach have got one problem which is that a few romans like IV that is 4 is not obtained by adding 5 and 1, instead we have to subtract 1 from 5. Hence the approach needs to be modified to account for such characters. It can be solved if we check the next character in loop and if it is greater than the character at place we subtract it from the next character and add the value to the sum, then we have to skip the next character and move ahead with the second next to continue to add to the sum until the value of i of loop is less than the length of string."
